Example source of AES-256/GCM Encryption and Decryption using Botan library.

This source uses Botan to achieve the encryption and decryption.

In order to use this, one have to compile the botan library and include into the project. 

https://github.com/randombit/botan

Example output using the default key and iv inside the source:

Encrypted String: N5VhEMeD5N4ioFRtEO836mkKA6d18vLF0u1SJtib6mt+pxWff3J5gWMsVtWmGlN13NONMAguBQ+E7WudD/F1MWEwOQdo1rJjcuC8j/ZZkooTdA==


Decrypted String: this string will be encrypted with aes-256 and encoded with base64
